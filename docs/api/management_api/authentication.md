# Authentication

Currently there is no authentication for the management api, but requests will most likely be authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth. You will need to provide an API key as the basic auth username. You won't need to provide a password.

Alternatively you could also pass your API key as a bearer token in an Authorization header.
